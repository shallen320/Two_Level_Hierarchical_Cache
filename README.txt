This project is to design an advance cache architecture consisting two levels of four way associative cache. There are four processors with 4 L1 caches and two L2 caches. The first and second L1 cache share one L1 bus, the third and fourth L1 caches share another L1 bus. Each L1 bus connects to a L2 cache, and then the two L2 caches share a single L2 bus, and connecting to two DRAM chips. Each L1 or L2 bus has an arbiter to grant access to caches with high priority.4 MMU lie between 4 L1 caches and buses beneath them, converting virtual address to physical address.
